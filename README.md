# UnityPractice

This is a "hello-world" Unity project for my Game Development class. 

If the game is running correctly, you should be able to see a red square on the blue background. The square can move up-left-down-right with the W A S D keys. It can also move diagonally with the Q(top left) Z(bottom-left) R(top-right) C(bottom-right) keys.
